# Python-Harvard-CS50-Challenges

A personal challenge to solve **130+ Python problem sets** inspired by **Harvard's CS50 curriculum.**

**Focus**: Algorithm design, Cryptography, and Data Science foundations.

# Python Mastery: 130+ Harvard-Style Challenges 🐍

Following my completion of the **100 C Programs Challenge**, I am now stepping into the world of Python.
This repository tracks my progress through **130+ problem sets** inspired by the rigorous **Harvard CS50 curriculum.**

## 🎯 The Mission
To transition from basic procedural logic to advanced algorithmic thinking, data structures, and Pythonic efficiency.

## 📊 Challenge Structure
The problems are divided into 13 levels, focusing on different core concepts:

### 🟢 Level 1: Foundations & Logic (Basics to Loops)
- [ ] **Problem 1:** The Change Maker - Calculating minimum coins using float-to-cent conversion.
- [ ] **Problem 2:** Credit Card Validator - Implementing Luhn's Algorithm for card integrity.
- [ ] **Problem 3:** Mario's Pyramid (Advanced) - Mastering nested loops and formatting.
- [ ] **Problem 4:** Collatz Conjecture - Simulating mathematical sequences.
- [ ] **Problem 5:** Vigenère Cipher - Keyword-based encryption logic.

### 🟡 Next Steps
- **Level 2-4:** Collections, Data Structures, and String Gymnastics.
- **Level 5-9**: Game Logic, Advanced Recursion, and System Design.
- **Level 10-13** The "Hacker" Data Sets and The Grand Finale.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Concepts:** Algorithms, Cryptography, Recursion, and Data Parsing.
- **Focus:** Error handling (try/except) and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
