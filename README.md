# Python-Harvard-CS50-Challenges

A personal challenge to solve **130+ Python problem sets** inspired by **Harvard's CS50 curriculum.**

**Focus**: Algorithm design, Cryptography, and Data Science foundations.

# Python Mastery: 130+ Harvard-Style Challenges 🐍

Following my completion of the **100 C Programs Challenge**, I am now stepping into the world of Python.
This repository tracks my progress through **130+ problem sets** inspired by the rigorous **Harvard CS50 curriculum.**

## 🎯 The Mission
To transition from basic procedural logic to advanced algorithmic thinking, data structures, and Pythonic efficiency.

## 📊 Full Challenge Structure (130+ Problems)

The problems are divided into 13 levels, focusing on different core concepts:
 
 ### 🟢 Phase 1: Algorithmic Foundations
 
- **Level 1:** Basics, Loops & Logic (Change Maker, Luhn's Algorithm, Ciphers)
- **Level 2:** Collections & Data Structures (DNA Matcher, Matrix Multiplier, Election Counter)
- **Level 3:** Functional Mastery & Recursion (Sudoku Validator, Tower of Hanoi, N-Queens)

### 🟡 Phase 2: Advanced Engineering

- **Level 4:** Mathematical Gymnastics (IP Validator, Pig Latin, Big Int Multiplication)
- **Level 5:** Game Logic & State Management (Tideman Algorithm, Minesweeper, Battleship)
- **Level 6:** Optimization & Backtracking (Recursive Maze Solver, Word Ladder, Merge Sort)

### 🔴 Phase 3: Specialized Systems

- **Level 7-9:** Cryptography, Physics Simulations, & System Design (Monte Carlo, Stock Profit, Markdown Parser)
- **Level 10-12:** "Hacker" Data Sets & Complex Simulations (Wordle Logic, Tax Bracket Calculator, Knight's Tour)
- **Level 13:** The Grand Finale (Bank Systems, Josephus Problem, & Master Quiz)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Concepts:** Algorithms, Cryptography, Recursion, and Data Parsing.
- **Focus:** Error handling (try/except) and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
